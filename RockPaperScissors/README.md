Rock Paper Scissors. 
A classic game for kids and adults making decisions. This will be an ongoing project in which we build this iconic game. 

First phase: 
    This will be the core functionality of the game, and will be built entirely in javascript, and played via the console. We will come back and add the GUI at a later date.
